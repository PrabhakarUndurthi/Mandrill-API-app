Send email from your app quickly and easily



Mandrill allows you to send emails from your website or application quickly and easily, and track the results.


If you don't have a Mandrill account, head to the Mandrill signup page to create one. https://mandrill.com/signup/
Drop in your email address and create a password.

Once you're logged in to your account, click the option to Get API keys. Generate a new key, and copy it so you can use it for the exercises.

You can access the API keys page in the future by going to Settings > SMTP & API Credentials.
